# This file configures global settings for Unity's Visual Effect Graph (VFX Graph).
# It corresponds to the settings found in Edit -> Project Settings -> VFX.
# The '!u!937362698' is Unity's internal class ID for VFXManager. '&1' is a YAML anchor.
--- !u!937362698 &1
VFXManager:
  # m_ObjectHideFlags: Internal Unity field for tracking object changes. Generally left untouched.
  m_ObjectHideFlags: 0

  # --- Shader Overrides ---
  # These fields allow overriding the default shaders used by VFX Graph for specific operations.
  # Most projects leave these unassigned (null / {fileID: 0}) unless advanced customization is needed.

  # m_IndirectShader: Shader used for GPU-based indirect drawing commands.
  m_IndirectShader: {fileID: 0} # Default: Not overridden

  # m_CopyBufferShader: Shader used for copying GPU buffer data.
  m_CopyBufferShader: {fileID: 0} # Default: Not overridden

  # m_SortShader: Shader used for sorting particles (e.g., for transparency).
  m_SortShader: {fileID: 0} # Default: Not overridden

  # m_StripUpdateShader: Shader used for updating triangle strips generated by VFX Graph.
  m_StripUpdateShader: {fileID: 0} # Default: Not overridden

  # --- Render Pipeline Integration ---
  # m_RenderPipeSettingsPath: Path to a VFX Scene Settings asset specific to the project's Render Pipeline (URP/HDRP).
  # If empty, VFX Graph might use default settings or assume the Built-in Render Pipeline context.
  # Example for URP: "Assets/Settings/ForwardRendererVFX.asset"
  m_RenderPipeSettingsPath: # Currently empty, using defaults or Built-in RP.

  # --- Simulation Timing ---
  # These settings control how VFX simulations are updated over time.

  # m_FixedTimeStep: The fixed interval (in seconds) at which VFX simulations update, independent of frame rate.
  # 0.016666668 corresponds to approximately 60 updates per second (1/60).
  m_FixedTimeStep: 0.016666668

  # m_MaxDeltaTime: The maximum time (in seconds) that a single simulation step can account for.
  # This prevents large simulation jumps or instability if the frame rate drops significantly.
  # 0.05 corresponds to a minimum simulation rate of 20 updates per second (1/20).
  m_MaxDeltaTime: 0.05

  # --- Other Common Settings (Not present in original, but often configured) ---
  # m_TotalCapacity: Maximum total particles allowed across all VFX systems. (e.g., 1048576)
  # m_MaxGPUCapacity / m_MaxCPUCapacity: Memory limits for GPU/CPU buffers.
